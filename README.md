##### This playground was created solely using SwiftUI - Apple's new declarative UI framework announced in 2019.

##### With this playground I wanted to demonstrate that although it is in its early stages as a framework, we can create basically anything that our imaginations give birth to.

##### Not a single graphic was used in the creation of this playground - everything you see is pure SwiftUI generated visuals.

###### *Runs best on MacOS Swift Playgrounds 3.3*
